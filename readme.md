# CMS Project - Manual
*This project was written by [MonokaiJs](https://www.facebook.com/MonokaiJssss), please do not remove this credit line

### Installation
Please run this script gently and carefully checking the dependencies.
```
npm i
cd client
npm i
cd ../
cd server
npm i
```
#### Why?
Since this project is written using ReactJs Framework for the Frontend along with Express on
Server-side, these two projects cannot be merged into one (or the merging process is really
complicated) so, I have decided to keep them separated. As the consequence, you have to manually
run `npm i` on all sub-projects.
### What's next?
Please read carefully about the documentation (may include with this project or the official
document of ReactJs, MongoDB, Express, etc...). Please note that this project currently using
a lot of frameworks, tools and features, so it may take you a bunch of time for understanding
the whole thing.
Finally, run this command to start your journey:
```
npm run dev
```
Also make sure that you have installed `concurrently` globally. You can install it with below
command:
```
npm i -g concurrently
```
